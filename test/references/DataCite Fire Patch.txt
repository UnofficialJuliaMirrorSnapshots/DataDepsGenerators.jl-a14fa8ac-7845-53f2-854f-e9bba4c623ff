	Fire patches computed from the MCD64A1 Collection 6 and the MERIS fire_cci v4.1 (2005-2011) burned area
	datasets. A flood-filling algorithm with a fixed cut-off parameter has been used to group burned pixels into
	fire patches. The listed morphological properties in the csv files are (in order of appearance) : ID, Fire
	ID, Minimum Burn Date, Maximum Burn Date, Mean Burn Date, Year, Number of Pixels, Number of Core Pixels,
	Area of the patch (ha), Core Area of the patch (ha), Perimeter, Perimeter to Area Ratio, Shape Index,
	Fractal Correlation Dimension, Core Area Index, Longitudinal coordinate of the center of the patch,
	Latitudinal coordinate of the center of the patch, Minor half-axis of the SDE (in degrees), Major and minor
	half-axes of the SDE (in degrees, in lonlat projection), major and minor half-axes of the SDE (in
	kilometers, in local flat projection), orientation of the SDE (with respect to North, clockwise, in
	degrees), orientation of the SDE in flat projection (with respect to North, clockwise, in degrees),
	eccentricity of the SDE, Ratio of SDE half axes. The NetCDF files are self-described.
